# 1- Quizz Kaamelott

This is a simple project I made to practice Javascript.

## Who I am

Currently in a dev web bootcamp since 1 month, I wanted to carry on practicing on Javascript even if I'm planning to specialize in back-end.

## What I learned

setTimeOut, modal window, listeners, DOM manipulation...

## Next Step

I will fetch the questions from an API, in order to get a different quizz each time.
